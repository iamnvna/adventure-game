### Project Fourteen - 100DaysOfCode
# Adventure Game
This is a simple program collects user inputs, and uses basic *if/else if/else* statements to run through various scenarios until the user amas enough points to win the game or lose all points and loses the game.
## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Create a variable and assign it the starting points available to the user.
3. Use basic if statements to run through various scenarios. These scenarios should:
* cause the user to lose points; where this happens, subtract the point lost from the initial starting points.
* cause the user to gain points; where this happens, add the points gained to the initial starting points.
4. Print the output to the user after a series of actions; if they lost or won.
10. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* This program improved my use of if/else if/else statement use.
* I tried creating two functions but found it difficult to call the global variable that held the points. I ended up nesting the game_over() function in the main game() function. I have more to learn on this.
